                <p>"For Asian students at MIT to experience God’s transformative love and be invited into a community
                    where every person intentionally seeks God and invests in one another."</p>
                <p>We are a community of primarily undergraduate students at MIT seeking to love the campus –
                    specifically the Asian and Asian-American community – and to embody Christ and the Good News as
                    witnesses and in our day-to-day lives. We believe that God's love, ultimately
                    embodied in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, is radical and transformative, and that our
                    community and this campus needs the healing and redemptive power of that love, which God first
                    showed and continues to show to us. We desire to build up a Christ-centered community seeking
                    holiness and living out love and fellowship together, so that our community as a whole would be a
                    witness and light to MIT, especially amidst the brokenness and stress that many students face
                    here.</p>
                <p>We are one of many Christian student groups on campus, all seeking to spread the love of Christ on
                    campus. Specifically, we are among the student groups under the United Christian Organization
                    (UCO), the umbrella organization uniting many of the official MIT Christian student groups, as well
                    as one of a few Asian Christian student groups and one of the InterVarsity chapters on campus. As
                    an ethnic-specific ministry, we desire to be God's vessels in bringing about the impossible
                    community pictured in Revelations — a people under God of many tribes, nations, and tongues. We
                    seek to do this by working in the lives of a specific ethnic group, i.e. Asians, that needs to
                    experience the love of God. </p>
                <p>ACF is intended to complement engaging regularly in a local church community; in
                    that light, the mission of ACF is tied to the unique position we have to reach MIT students in a
                    way that other Christian communities outside of MIT cannot. Students of all backgrounds are welcome
                    to join the ACF community and to be a part of our mission to love the Asian community and serve as
                    a light on this campus in that way.</p>
                <p>We are a non-denominational fellowship, upholding the doctrinal basis put forth by InterVarsity.
                    Please feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about what we believe.</p>

                <br>
                <p>MIT ACF is a chapter of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (IVCF), an interdenominational
                    evangelical student-oriented ministry incorporated in 1941. InterVarsity comes from England, where
                    the term “varsity” referred to one’s school—thus InterVarsity literally means “Inter-School”
                    Christian Fellowship. In 2017-2018, IVCF/USA had more than 36,000 students and faculty participate
                    in its ministries.
                    IVCF has more than 1000 chapters on over 650 campuses nationwide and employs nearly 1000 campus
                    field staff.</p>
                <p>As an InterVarsity chapter, ACF has staff trained specifically for and devoted to college student
                    ministry. Additionally, InterVarsity provides numerous resources and opportunities for building
                    community across campuses and growing faith through retreats, conferences, their publishing
                    company, service and missions trips, and many other opportunities.</p>

                <br>
                <p>MIT ACF was started originally as MIT KCF (Korean Christian Fellowship) in the Fall of 1990. A group
                    10 students (including Cindy Kim, Gene Sohn, Franklin Ko, J.P. Kang, Young Park, Jane Song, Marie
                    Lee and Esther Cho) believed that there should be an English-speaking services for Korean Americans
                    in the Boston Area, and so after extended prayer and thought, they started an informal “fellowship”
                    amongst themselves.</p>
                <p>That winter at Urbana 1990, a member of KCF sat down with the Boston Area director of Intervarsity
                    and talked about bringing in KCF to Intervarsity as well as the possibility of giving KCF an
                    Intervarsity staff member. This became a reality in the Spring of 1992, when Soon-Chan joined as
                    KCF’s first part-time staff worker.</p>
                <p>The fellowship grew steadily, and in 2000, the name of KCF was changed to ACF (Asian Christian
                    Fellowship), as there had always been a good percentage of non-Koreans in the fellowship and most
                    of our outreach was to Koreans as well. We’ve been praising God as MIT ACF ever since!</p>
